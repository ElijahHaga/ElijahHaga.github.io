    This PCB is a Gameboy Color Cartridge circuit board that I reverse engineered. I researched the parts in the
    original cartridges, recreated them in modern 3D models and footprints, and arranged them in the same positions
    they are in in the original cartridges, but I routed the traces and placed the copper pour to my own design.
    It uses an MBC5 chip to map storage to a MX23C8005-12 read-only memory (ROM) to store the game files, and a
    W24257S-70LL random access memory (RAM) chip to store the save states for the player. It also has a MM1134A
    as a back-up IC. It interfaces with the Gameboy Color using a 32-pin card edge slot. I used Altium Designer
    and the <a href="https://github.com/issus/altium-library" target="_blank">Celestial Altium Library</a> for this
    project as well. This was another project that I did to improve my ECAD skills and to practice reverse
    engineering of circuit boards.

    This circuit board is an LED ring PCB that I designed in <a href="https://www.flux.ai/" target="_blank">Flux</a>,
    a free browser-based ECAD. It uses an STM32F030CCT6 microcontroller and a BMI160 6-axis gyroscope to control 20
    LEDs depending on the orientation of the circuit board. It is charged an programmed by a USB-C port. I thought
    of, researched, and designed this circuit board completely on my own, doing my own parts selection and BOM while
    learning how to use Flux. I definitely prefer Altium Designer, but I used Flux to see how well I could adapt my
    skills to a completely different ECAD.

    This circuit board is a clone of a Raspberry Pi Pico that I deisgned to improve my ECAD skills. I used Altium
    Designer and the <a href="https://github.com/issus/altium-library" target="_blank">Celestial Altium Library</a>,
    a free online library of components for the simplier electronics of circuit board, although I designed the
    RP2040 model and a few other more complicated components myself. The circuit board uses an RP2040 microcontroller,
    which can be programmed using the Raspberry Pi operating system and Python. This was my first project in
    computer/control boards, which is the board design I like most.

    For my final project in AP Chem, I chose to research and fabricate a lithium-ion battery using the materials in
    my high school's lab so as to get a better understanding of how Lithium-ion batteries work. I only had a month to complete this assignment, so I was not able to document much of the
    process, but I have my attached lab report about my findings. As my report states, I
    used a Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) cathode (specifically low-temperature LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, I
    eplain this important distinction in my paper) and a graphite anode. These materials were ground into powders to achieve
    an even charge distribution, then are mixed with a binding agent (in my case, PTFE, commonly known as teflon), a
    condutive agent (I used carbon black), and a solvent to dissolve the binder, which I used isopropanol
    (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) for. The mixture was distrubuted evenly to a aluminum sheet for the cathode and a
    copper sheet for the anode. An ion-bridge must be constructed to allow the lithium ions to travel between the
    cathode and anode, which I made out of polyethylene ((C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) due to it's high
    availability (it's what plastic bags are made of) soaked in lithium perchlorate (LiClO<sub>4</sub>) as an
    electrolyte dissolved in ethyl-methyl-carbonate (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which I had to harvest
    from another battery as they were impossible to create with the materials provided to me. The ion-bridge was sandwiched
    between the anode and cathode, then a wire with a resistor and LED were connected to the anode and cathode, along
    with an oscilloscope probe. I was successfully able to measure a voltage of around 4 Volts for a short period before
    the battery caught on wire, likely due to the anode and cathode powders spilling over the separator and shorting
    together. Although the battery had to be destroyed, it proved successful in discharging for a short period of time.

    I created this portflio to apply for your internship. However, I did not want it to be a boring, typical portfolio,
    so I designed the whole thing using GitHub Pages, which allows you to have one free webpage per GitHub account.
    This meant that I had to learn website programming, which I had never done before. Creating the typical HTML elements
    was quite easy; the real challenge started with using CSS and Javascript to style my webpage, such as creating
    the image carousels and the button that toggles the paper I wrote on batteries. However, through documentation
    online I was able to figure these elements out and make my webpage more interesting. P.S. I know VSCode says there's
    an error in the style.scss file, but there is not, the part that is raising an error is what allows the webpage to
    access the file.
